	abstract = {Despite widespread availability of ultrasound and a need for personalised muscle diagnosis (neck/back pain-injury, work related disorder, myopathies, neuropathies), robust, online segmentation of muscles within complex groups remains unsolved by existing methods. For example, Cervical Dystonia (CD) is a prevalent neurological condition causing painful spasticity in one or multiple muscles in the cervical muscle system. Clinicians currently have no method for targeting/monitoring treatment of deep muscles. Automated methods of muscle segmentation would enable clinicians to study, target, and monitor the deep cervical muscles via ultrasound. We have developed a method for segmenting ﬁve bilateral cervical muscles and the spine via ultrasound alone, in real-time. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound data were collected from 22 participants (age: 29.0±6.6, male: 12). To acquire ultrasound muscle segment labels, a novel multimodal registration method was developed, involving MRI image annotation, and shape registration to MRI-matched ultrasound images, via approximation of the tissue deformation. We then applied polynomial regression to transform our annotations and textures into a mean space, before using shape statistics to generate a texture-to-shape dictionary. For segmentation, test images were compared to dictionary textures giving an initial segmentation, and then we used a customized Active Shape Model to reﬁne the ﬁt. Using ultrasound alone, on unseen participants, our technique currently segments a single image in ≈0.45s to over 86\% accuracy (Jaccard index). We propose this approach is applicable generally to segment, extrapolate and visualise deep muscle structure, and analyse statistical features online.},

	abstract = {Objectives—The purpose of this study was to determine whether the physical properties and vascular environment of active myofascial trigger points associated with acute spontaneous cervical pain, asymptomatic latent trigger points, and palpably normal muscle differ in terms of the trigger point area, pulsatility index, and resistivity index, as measured by sonoelastography and Doppler imaging.
Methods—Sonoelastography was performed with an external 92-Hz vibration in the upper trapezius muscles in patients with acute cervical pain and at least 1 palpable trigger point (n = 44). The area of reduced vibration amplitude was measured as an estimate of the size of the stiff myofascial trigger points. Patients also underwent triplex Doppler imaging of the same region to analyze blood flow waveforms and calculate the pulsatility index of blood flow in vessels at or near the trigger points.
Results—On sonoelastography, active sites (spontaneously painful with palpable myofascial trigger points) had larger trigger points (mean ± SD, 0.57 ± 0.20 cm2) compared to latent sites (palpable trigger points painful on palpation; 0.36 ± 0.16 cm2) and palpably normal sites (0.17 ± 0.22 cm2; P {\textless} .01). Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves showed that area measurements could robustly distinguish between active, latent, and normal sites (areas under the curve, 0.9 for active versus latent, 0.8 for active versus normal, and 0.8 for latent versus normal, respectively). Doppler spectral waveform data showed that vessels near active sites had a significantly higher pulsatility index (median, 8.3) compared to normal sites (median, 3.0; P {\textless} . 05).
Conclusions—The results presented in this study show that myofascial trigger points may be classified by area using sonoelastography. Furthermore, monitoring the trigger point area and pulsatility index may be useful in evaluating the natural history of myofascial pain syndrome.},

	abstract = {Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) are palpable, tender nodules in taut bands of skeletal muscle that are painful on compression. MTrPs are characteristic findings in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). The role of MTrPs in the pathophysiology of MPS is unknown. Localization, diagnosis, and clinical outcome measures of painful MTrPs can be improved by objectively characterizing and quantitatively measuring their properties. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether ultrasound imaging and elastography can differentiate symptomatic (active) MTrPs from normal muscle. Patients with chronic ({\textgreater}3 months) neck pain with spontaneously painful, palpable (i.e., active) MTrPs and healthy volunteers without spontaneous pain (having palpably normal muscle tissue) were recruited for this study. The upper trapezius muscles in all subjects were imaged, and the echotexture was analyzed using entropy filtering of B-mode images. Vibration elastography was performed by vibrating the muscle externally at 100 Hz. Color Doppler variance imaging was used to quantify the regions of color deficit exhibiting low vibration amplitude. The imaging measures were compared against the clinical findings of a standardized physical exam. We found that sites with active MTrPs ( n = 14) have significantly lower entropy ( p {\textless} 0.05) and significantly larger nonvibrating regions ( p {\textless} 0.05) during vibration elastography compared with normal, uninvolved muscle ( n = 15). A combination of both entropy analysis and vibration elastography yielded 69\% sensitivity and 81\% specificity in discriminating active MTrPs from normal muscle. These results suggest that active MTrPs have more homogeneous texture and heterogeneous stiffness when compared with normal, unaffected muscle. Our methods enabled us to improve the imaging contrast between suspected MTrPs and surrounding muscle. Our results indicate that in subjects with chronic neck pain and active MTrPs, the abnormalities are not confined to discrete isolated nodules but instead affect the milieu of the muscle surrounding palpable MTrPs. With further refinement, ultrasound imaging can be a promising objective method for characterizing soft tissue abnormalities associated with active MTrPs and elucidating the role of MTrPs in the pathophysiology of MPS.},

	abstract = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been the predominant method for sensing electrical activity for a number of applications involving muscle–computer interfaces, including myoelectric control of prostheses and rehabilitation robots. Ultrasound imaging for sensing mechanical deformation of functional muscle compartments can overcome several limitations of sEMG, including the inability to differentiate between deep contiguous muscle compartments, low signal-to-noise ratio, and lack of a robust graded signal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of real-time graded control using a computationally efﬁcient method to differentiate between complex hand motions based on ultrasound imaging of forearm muscles. Dynamic ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained from six able-bodied volunteers and analyzed to map muscle activity based on the deformation of the contracting muscles during different hand motions. Each participant performed 15 different hand motions, including digit ﬂexion, different grips (i.e., power grasp and pinch grip), and grips in combination with wrist pronation. During the training phase, we generated a database of activity patterns corresponding to different hand motions for each participant. During the testing phase, novel activity patterns were classiﬁed using a nearest neighbor classiﬁcation algorithm based on that database. The average classiﬁcation accuracy was 91\%. Real-time image-based control of a virtual hand showed an average classiﬁcation accuracy of 92\%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrasound imaging as a robust muscle–computer interface. Potential clinical applications include control of multiarticulated prosthetic hands, stroke rehabilitation, and fundamental investigations of motor control and biomechanics.},

To compare the reliability and accuracy of visual estimation, tape measurement, and the universal goniometer (UG) with that of the CROM goniometer in measuring active CROM in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective was to identify the single neck movement that best represents overall range of motion. Neck movement is affected by pathology in the spine and shoulder. A reliable and accurate measurement of neck movement is required to quantify injury, recovery, and disability. Various methods of measuring neck movement have been described of which radiography remains the accepted reference standard. However, radiography is impractical for routine clinical assessment. Visual estimation, tape measurement, and the UG are convenient alternatives. To date, the accuracy and reliability of these methods have not been compared in healthy subjects, and the single neck movement that best reflects overall range has not yet been identified. Active cervical flexion, extension, right and left lateral flexion and rotation were measured in 100 healthy volunteers. Visual estimation, tape measurement between fixed landmarks, and the UG aligned on fixed and anatomic landmarks were compared with the CROM goniometer, which was used as the reference standard. Compared with the CROM goniometer, the UG aligned on fixed landmarks was the most accurate method, followed by the UG on anatomic landmarks. The reliability of the UG was between substantial and perfect. Visual estimation was reproducible but measured range of movement inaccurately. Tape measurement was inaccurate. Extension best reflected overall range.},

Methods: Eighteen healthy adults participated. Differences in contraction onset were compared between sEMG, fwEMG, and M-mode ultrasound collected during concentric contractions of the vastus lateralis and biceps brachii. Results: The mean difference of 13.1 ms (-33.3–59.9) between sEMG and fwEMG was non-signiﬁcant (intraclass correlation [ICC] = 0.60). Ultrasound was signiﬁcantly different from surface and ﬁne wire EMG (ICC = 0.65 and ICC = 0.40, respectively), occurring 98.6 ms (72.3–124.9) and 111.7 (60.3–163.0) before sEMG and fwEMG, respectively. Nonparametric interquartile ranges were also wide. Conclusions: Due to high variability, comparisons between EMG methods should be interpreted with caution. Ultrasound detected onset before either EMG method, which may indicate motion from adjacent muscles during voluntary contractions.},

	abstract = {To investigate the ability of ultrasonography to estimate muscle activity, we measured architectural parameters (pennation angles, fascicle lengths, and muscle thickness) of several human muscles (tibialis anterior, biceps brachii, brachialis, transversus abdominis, obliquus internus abdominis, and obliquus externus abdominis) during isometric contractions of from 0 to 100\% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Concurrently, electromyographic (EMG) activity was measured with surface (tibialis anterior only) or fine‐wire electrodes. Most architectural parameters changed markedly with contractions up to 30\% MVC but changed little at higher levels of contraction. Thus, ultrasound imaging can be used to detect low levels of muscle activity but cannot discriminate between moderate and strong contractions. Ultrasound measures could reliably detect changes in EMG of as little as 4\% MVC (biceps muscle thickness), 5\% MVC (brachialis muscle thickness), or 9\% MVC (tibialis anterior pennation angle). They were generally less sensitive to changes in abdominal muscle activity, but it was possible to reliably detect contractions of 12\% MVC in transversus abdominis (muscle length) and 22\% MVC in obliquus internus (muscle thickness). Obliquus externus abdominis thickness did not change consistently with muscle contraction, so ultrasound measures of thickness cannot be used to detect activity of this muscle. Ultrasound imaging can thus provide a noninvasive method of detecting isometric muscle contractions of certain individual muscles. Muscle Nerve 27: 682–692, 2003},

METHODS: Images of LM thickness in 15 healthy subjects were captured and measured by static images and video methods. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95\% confidence interval, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change were calculated to determine the reliability and precision of the LM thickness measurements. RESULTS: Excellent intra-rater reliability was demonstrated in measuring LM muscle thickness using both methods, with the intra-rater ICC ranging from 0.75 to 0.95. CONCLUSION: The reliability of the LM thickness measurements in video ultrasound is similar to that in the static images method in healthy subjects.},

	abstract = {There is a growing trend in the physical therapy profession to use conventional grayscale brightness (B-mode) ultrasound imaging (USI) as a tool to assess the morphological (form and structure) and morphometric (measures of form) characteristics of muscle, and to use these findings to draw conclusions regarding muscle function. This trend is reflected in numerous published investigations. As many physical therapists may lack training in the principles and instrumentation underlying USI use, it is critical that therapists gain a clear understanding of the information that USI can, and cannot, provide about muscle function before employing the technique for either research or clinical applications. Failure to do so may result in the propagation of inaccurate terminology and beliefs. This paper aims to clarify the role that USI has in the assessment of muscle function, first, by briefly reviewing how conventional grayscale B-mode ultrasound images and clips are generated, and second, by summarizing the types of information that these images can provide. It also discusses the various factors that need to be considered when interpreting a dynamic USI assessment of muscle specifically as it relates to the assessment of muscle function.

MTrPs are characteristic findings in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). The role of MTrPs in the pathophysiology of MPS is unknown. Localization, diagnosis, and clinical outcome measures of painful MTrPs can be improved by objectively characterizing and quantitatively measuring their properties. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether ultrasound imaging and elastography can differentiate symptomatic (active) MTrPs from normal muscle. Patients with chronic ({\textgreater}3 months) neck pain with spontaneously painful, palpable (i.e., active) MTrPs and healthy volunteers without spontaneous pain (having palpably normal muscle tissue) were recruited for this study. The upper trapezius muscles in all subjects were imaged, and the echotexture was analyzed using entropy filtering of B-mode images. Vibration elastography was performed by vibrating the muscle externally at 100 Hz. Color Doppler variance imaging was used to quantify the regions of color deficit exhibiting low vibration amplitude. The imaging measures were compared against the clinical findings of a standardized physical exam. We found that sites with active MTrPs ( n = 14) have significantly lower entropy ( p {\textless} 0.05) and significantly larger nonvibrating regions ( p {\textless} 0.05) during vibration elastography compared with normal, uninvolved muscle ( n = 15). A combination of both entropy analysis and vibration elastography yielded 69\% sensitivity and 81\% specificity in discriminating active MTrPs from normal muscle. These results suggest that active MTrPs have more homogeneous texture and heterogeneous stiffness when compared with normal, unaffected muscle. Our methods enabled us to improve the imaging contrast between suspected MTrPs and surrounding muscle. Our results indicate that in subjects with chronic neck pain and active MTrPs, the abnormalities are not confined to discrete isolated nodules but instead affect the milieu of the muscle surrounding palpable MTrPs. With further refinement, ultrasound imaging can be a promising objective method for characterizing soft tissue abnormalities associated with active MTrPs and elucidating the role of MTrPs in the pathophysiology of MPS.},

The muscle thickness ratio of the trapezius muscle showed a significant  difference between 11 kg and 5 and 8 kg, and between 5 kg and 8 and 11 kg, as  well as between 8 kg and 11 kg for the splenius capitis muscles. [Conclusion]  Differences in muscle direction between the trapezius and splenius capitis  muscles may account for the contrasting results obtained at the 8 kg traction  force. This finding suggests that cervical traction must be performed considering  the effects on different neck regions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several tests have been suggested to assess the isometric endurance of the cervical flexor (NFME) and extensors (NEE) muscles. This study proposes to  determine whether neck flexors endurance is related to extensor endurance, and  whether cervical muscle endurance is related to disability, pain amount and pain  stage in subjects with neck pain. METHODS: Thirty subjects (18 women, 12 men,  mean ± SD age: 43 ± 12 years) complaining of neck pain filled out the Visual  Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Neck Pain and Disability Scale-Italian version  (NPDS-I). They also completed the timed endurance tests for the cervical muscles.  RESULTS: The mean endurance was 246.7 ± 150 seconds for the NEE test, and  44.9 ± 25.3 seconds for the NMFE test. A significant correlation was found  between the results of these two tests (r = 0.52, p = 0.003). A positive  relationship was also found between VAS and NPDS-I (r = 0.549, p = 0.002). The  endurance rates were similar for acute/subacute and chronic subjects, whereas  males demonstrated significantly higher values compared to females in NFME test.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that neck flexors and extensors endurance are  correlated and that the cervical endurance is not significantly altered by the  duration of symptoms in subjects with neck pain.},

The purpose of this  study was to determine whether training of deep cervical flexor muscles with  pressure biofeedback has any significant advantage over conventional training for  pain and disability experienced by school teachers with neck pain. [Subjects]  Thirty teachers aged 25-45 years with neck pain and poor craniocervical flexion  test participated in this study.

Measurements of dependent variables were taken at baseline, and  after 2 and 4 weeks of training. Pain intensity was assessed using a numeric pain  rating scale and functional disability was assessed using the neck disability  index. [Results] The data analysis revealed that there was significant  improvement in pain and disability in both the groups and the results were better  in the experimental group.

This study investigated the recruitment pattern of the neck  muscles, particularly the DCF, during the Craniocervical Flexion Test (CCFT),  using ultrasound measurement of muscle activity in asymptomatic subjects. In a  cross-sectional design, 10 subjects, of both sexes, with no history of neck pain  participated in the study. Participants were instructed to perform the CCFT, and  changes in thickness from resting baseline values during the five incremental  stages of the test were obtained for DCF and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles  using ultrasonography. The most significant changes found in DCF thickness were  between phase 1 and phases 4 (p{\textless}0.001) and 5 (p= {\textless}0.001). For SCM, differences  were most significant between phases 1 and 3 (p{\textless}0.001), 4 (p{\textless}0.001), and 5  (p{\textless}0.001); and between phases 3 and 5 (p{\textless}0.003). No differences were found  between DCF and SCM muscles. The present study confirms the evidence that CCFT  increases DCF recruitment. However, the ultrasonography test protocol did not  identify differences in recruitment between deep and superficial neck muscles.  The present study confirms the evidence that the CCFT challenges the cervical  spine and that DCF activity is increased during this maneuver.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe and explain the variation of neck muscle strength along the cervical spine. A three-dimensional model of the head-neck  complex was developed to test the hypothesis that the moment-generating capacity  of the neck musculature is lower in the upper cervical spine than in the lower  cervical spine. The model calculations suggest that the neck muscles can protect  the lower cervical spine from injury during extension and lateral bending. The  maximum flexor moment developed in the lower cervical spine was 2 times higher  than that developed in the upper spine. The model also predicted that the neck  musculature is 30\% stronger in the lower cervical spine during lateral bending.  Peak compressive forces (up to 3 times body weight) were higher in the lower  cervical spine. These results are consistent with the clinical finding that  extension loading of the neck often leads to injuries in the upper cervical  spine. Analysis of the model results showed that neck flexor strength was greater  in the lower cervical spine because of the relatively large size of the  sternocleidomastoid muscle. The hyoid muscles developed significant flexor  moments about the joints of the upper cervical spine, as these muscles had  relatively large flexor moment arms; however, this effect was offset by the  action of the sternocleidomastoid, which exerted a large extensor moment in the  upper spine. Lateral bending strength of the neck muscles was governed by  geometry (i.e., moment arms) rather than by muscle size.},

Neck muscle stiffness can be investigated with ultrasound shear wave  elastography. OBJECTIVES: To determine if migraine patients with ictal neck pain  have stiffer neck muscles interictally compared with patients without ictal neck  pain and controls. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study investigating neck  muscle stiffness, pressure pain thresholds and neck pain symptoms in 100 migraine  patients recruited from a tertiary headache center and 46 controls. RESULTS:  Patients with ictal neck pain had increased mean neck muscle stiffness  interictally compared to both migraine patients without ictal neck pain  (p = 0.018) and controls (p = 0.036). Muscle stiffness was negatively correlated  with pressure pain thresholds in the neck in migraine patients with ictal neck  pain (r = -0.292, p = 0.042). There were no differences in mean pressure pain  thresholds between migraine subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine patients with ictal  neck pain have stiffer neck muscles interictally compared with migraine patients  without ictal neck pain and controls measured with ultrasound shear wave  elastography. The increased stiffness could be due to local alterations in the  neck muscles. Trial registration: clinical-trials.gov, identifier: NCT03626805.},

Surface electromyographies of three paired cervical muscles  were measured in 17 young healthy subjects. The subjects performed voluntary neck  movements in sagittal and coronal plane at fast, medium, and slow speeds. The  co-contraction ratio was defined as the normalized integration of antagonistic  electromyographic activities divided by that of total muscle activities. The  results showed that the co-contraction ratio at fast speed (0.42 +/- 0.21) was  smaller than that at medium (0.45 +/- 0.20) and slow (0.46 +/- 0.19) speeds (P  {\textless}/= 0.001). The co-contraction ratio was different between flexion and extension,  but was similar between left and right lateral bending. The implications of  co-contraction patterns include: (1) agonistic activities increase with speed but  antagonistic activities do not increase accordingly; (2) neck extensors are  highly activated during sagittal motions; and (3) muscular activations are  symmetric during coronal motions. In conclusion, the co-contraction patterns from  young healthy subjects demonstrate normal neuromuscular control in regulating the  stiffness of cervical spine, and may further be references to assess the neck  disorders in elderly or patients.},

METHODS: A total of 54 individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain were  randomly allocated to three groups: extensor training, flexor training, or  control. A Thai version of the Neck Disability Index, numeric pain scale (NPS),  CV angle, and neck-muscle strength were measured at baseline, immediately after 6  weeks of training, and at 1- and 3 -month follow-up. RESULTS: Neck Disability  Index scores improved significantly more in the exercise groups than in the  control group after 6 weeks training and at 1- and 3-month follow-up in both the  exten-sor (P=0.001) and flexor groups (P=0.003, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively).  NPS scores also improved significantly more in the exercise groups than in the  control group after 6 weeks' training in both the extensor (P{\textless}0.0001) and flexor  groups (P=0.029. In both exercise groups, the CV angle improved significantly  compared with the control group at 6 weeks and 3 months (extensor group, P=0.008  and P=0.01, respectively; flexor group, P=0.002 and 0.009, respectively). At 1  month, the CV angle had improved significantly in the flexor group (P=0.006).  Muscle strength in both exercise groups had improved significantly more than in  the control group at 6 weeks and 1- and 3-month follow-up (extensor group,  P=0.04, P=0.02, P=0.002, respectively; flexor group, P=0.002, P=0.001, and 0.001,  respectively). The semispinalis group gained extensor strength and the deep  cervical flexor group gained flexor strength. CONCLUSION: The results suggest  that 6 weeks of training in both exercise groups can improve neck disability,  pain intensity, CV angle, and neck-muscle strength in chronic mechanical neck  pain.

METHODS: Twenty college students with  FHP (mean age 21.30 ± 2.36 years) and 20 students with NHP (mean age 21.85 ± 2.78  years) participated in this case-control study. The thickness of neck extensor  muscles was measured at rest and at maximal voluntary isometric contraction  (MVIC). In addition, the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was calculated. To compare  thickness changes between the 2 groups and among 5 muscles, a 2-way repeated  measures analysis of variance was applied. In addition, Pearson's correlation  test was performed to investigate the relationship between neck extensor MVIC and  CVA. RESULTS: The FHP group demonstrated lower MVIC compared with the NHP group  (P = .03). Semispinalis capitis showed the smallest thickness changes during neck  extensor MVIC in FHP compared with the controls (P {\textless} .001). However, no  significant difference in terms of muscle thickness was observed between the 2  groups at the state of rest (P = .16-.99). A positive association was also found  between the MVIC and CVA (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Semispinalis capitis had less  thickness changes during MVIC of neck extensors in individuals with FHP compared  with those with NHP. This indirectly implies lower activity of this muscle in FHP  condition. This study finding may help researchers develop therapeutic exercise  protocols to manage FHP.},

Forty-six chronic neck pain subjects were randomly assigned  to an exercise group and undertook a 6-week training program.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has established the presence of reduced cervical  flexor, extensor, and rotator muscle strength in individuals with neck pain. Some  authors have suggested that individuals with neck pain have limited strength of  the lower trapezius muscle, yet no research has investigated this claim. METHODS:  Twenty-five individuals with unilateral neck pain participated in this study.  Participants completed the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) as a  measure of disability. Side of neck pain, duration of neck pain, and hand  dominance were recorded. Lower trapezius muscle strength was assessed bilaterally  in each participant, using a handheld dynamometer. RESULTS: A significant  difference in lower trapezius strength was found between sides (P{\textless}.001), with  participants demonstrating an average of 3.9 N less force on the side of neck  pain. The tested levels of association between NPQ score and percent strength  deficit (r = -0.31, P = .13), and between symptom duration and percent strength  deficit (r = -0.25, P = .22), were not statistically significant. No significant  association was found between hand dominance and side of stronger lower trapezius  (P = .59). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that individuals  with unilateral neck pain exhibit significantly less lower trapezius strength on  the side of neck pain compared to the contralateral side. This study suggests a  possible association between lower trapezius muscle weakness and neck pain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neck muscle compositional changes may represent potential biomarkers contributing towards chronic neck-related pain and disability. OBJECTIVES: To  determine differences in muscle volume in the cervical muscles of individuals  with chronic idiopathic neck pain compared with age- and sex-matched asymptomatic  individuals, and to determine if these muscle variables relate to spinal level,  side (left or right), age, sex, body mass index (BMI) or muscle strength. STUDY  DESIGN: Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. METHODS: Muscle  volume of five muscle (groups) from cervical levels C3-T1 in 20 pain and 17  asymptomatic participants were quantified using MRI: levator scapulae, multifidus  including semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis, splenius capitus including  splenius cervicis, and sternocleidomastoid. Isometric extensor and flexor muscle  strength were assessed with a dynamometer. Linear mixed modelling determined  differences between groups in muscle volume accounting for participant  characteristics. RESULTS: Individuals with pain had greater muscle volume  (adjusted mean difference 71.2 mm(3) (95\% CI 14.2-128.2, p = .015) of the  sternocleidomastoid, accounting for spinal level, side, muscle group (extensors  vs flexor), sex, age, body mass index and strength. Modelling indicated muscle  volume differed between spinal levels (p {\textless} .001); greater extensor muscle  strength was associated with greater volume (p = .011); female sex (p {\textless} .001) and  older age (p = .012) were associated with less volume. CONCLUSION: Between-group  differences in cervical flexor muscle volume, and volume differences across  spinal levels and muscles suggest the contribution of cervical muscles to chronic  idiopathic neck pain is multifaceted and complex.},

[Subjects and Methods]  A total of 18 students (9 males and 9 females) with neck pain at D University in  Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea, participated in this study. The change in muscle  thickness in superficial and deep cervical flexor muscles during the  craniocervical flexion test was measured using ultrasonography. The ratio of  muscle thickness changes between superficial and deep muscles during the test  were obtained to interpret the imbalance of muscle recruitment in cervical flexor  muscles. [Results] The muscle thickness ratio of the sternocleidomastoid  muscle/deep cervical flexor muscles according to the incremental pressure showed  significant differences between 22 mmHg and 24 mmHg, between 24 mmHg and 28 mmHg,  between 24 mmHg and 30 mmHg, and between 26 mmHg and 28 mmHg. [Conclusion]  Ultrasonography can be applied for examination of cervical flexor muscles in  clinical environment, and practical suggestion for intervention exercise of  craniocervical flexors can be expected on the pressure level between 24 mmHg and  26 mmHg enabling the smallest activation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.},

The purpose of the present study was to investigate  deformation and deformation rate in different layers of dorsal and ventral neck  muscles during isometric neck muscle contraction in individuals after anterior  cervical decompression and fusion and in healthy controls. This study included 10  individuals (mean age 60 years; SD 7.1) with a verified, long-standing neck  disorder and 10 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Ultrasonography and  post-process speckle tracking analysis was used to investigate the degree and the  rate of neck muscles motions at the C4 segmental level during sub-maximal,  isometric resistance of the head in a seated position. None of the analyses  performed showed significant differences between groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In the dorsal  muscles, both groups exhibited a higher deformation rate in the multifidus than  in the trapezius, splenius, and semispinalis capitis (p ≤ 0.01). In the neck  disorder group, the multifidus also showed a higher deformation rate compared to  the semispinalis cervicis (p = 0.02). In the ventral muscles of patients with  neck disorders, the longus colli had a higher deformation rate than the  sternocleidomastoid (p = 0.02). Among the healthy controls, the multifidus showed  a higher degree of deformation (p = 0.02) than the trapezius. In conclusion, our  results showed no significant differences between the two groups in mechanical  neck muscle activation. Larger studies with different exercises, preferably with  a standardized measure of resistance, are needed to investigate whether patients  and controls show differences in deformation and deformation rates in neck  muscles.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional non-comparative study with single group repeated  measurements. METHODS: Altogether 219 healthy females aged 20-59 years  volunteered to participate in the study. The IET was performed in the supine  position and MIST seated. The reproducibility was evaluated by the intraclass  correlation coefficient (ICC) and an analysis described by Bland and Altman. The  relationship between the two measuring methods was evaluated by Pearson's  correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The mean (SD) IET time was 60 (33) seconds with  no significant differences between the age groups of each decade. The ICC for  intrarater repeatability was 0.80. However, the Bland-Altman analysis suggested  moderate variation in repeated measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient  between the IET and MIST was 0.56. CONCLUSION: Normative reference values for the  IET are presented. Although the ICC showed good repeatability, one should  consider that the change at follow-up visits has to be considerable to be  clinically relevant. The correlation between the endurance time and maximal  flexion strength was moderate. Thus IET of the cervical flexor muscles may be  used in the clinic like the Biering-Sorenson test has been used to assess fatigue  of the trunk extensor muscles.},

This  masterclass will present recent research from our laboratory, which has utilized  surface electromyography to investigate cervical flexor muscle impairment in  patients with chronic neck pain. This research has identified deficits in the  motor control of the deep and superficial cervical flexor muscles in people with  chronic neck pain, characterized by a delay in onset of neck muscle contraction  associated with movement of the upper limb. In addition, people with neck pain  demonstrate an altered pattern of muscle activation, which is characterized by  reduced deep cervical flexor muscle activity during a low load cognitive task and  increased activity of the superficial cervical flexor muscles during both  cognitive tasks and functional activities. The results have demonstrated the  complex, multifaceted nature of cervical muscle impairment, which exists in  people with a history of neck pain. In turn, this has considerable implications  for the rehabilitation of muscle function in people with neck pain disorders.},

Fifty-eight female patients with chronic neck pain were  randomised into one of two 6-week exercise intervention groups: an  endurance-strength training regime for the cervical flexor muscles or low-load  training of the cranio-cervical flexor muscles. The primary outcome was a change  in electromyographic (EMG) amplitude of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle  during a functional, repetitive upper limb task.

Further investigation of this  technique is warranted to ensure EMG activity from neighbouring muscles is not  markedly influencing the signals recorded. This study compared deep cervical  flexor (DCF) muscle activity with the activity of surrounding neck and jaw  muscles during various anatomical movements of the neck and jaw in 10 volunteer  subjects. DCF EMG activity was recorded with custom electrodes inserted via the  nose and fixed by suction to the posterior mucosa of the oropharynx. Surface  electrodes were placed over the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene, masseter  and suprahyoid muscles. Positioned in supine, subjects performed isometric  cranio-cervical flexion, cervical flexion, right and left cervical rotation, jaw  clench and resisted jaw opening. Across all movements examined, EMG amplitude of  the DCF muscles was greatest during neck movements that would require activity of  the DCF muscles, particularly during cranio-cervical flexion, their primary  anatomical action. The actions of jaw clench and resisted jaw opening  demonstrated significantly less DCF EMG activity than the cranio-cervical flexion  action (p{\textless}0.05). Across all other movements, the neighbouring neck and jaw  muscles demonstrated greatest EMG amplitude during their respective primary  anatomical actions, which occurred in the absence of increased EMG amplitude  recorded from the DCF muscles. The finding of substantial EMG activity of the DCF  muscles only during neck actions that would require their activity, particularly  cranio-cervical flexion, and not during actions involving the jaw, provide  further assurance that the majority of myoelectric signals detected from the  nasopharyngeal electrode are from the DCF muscles.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) is a clinical test of the anatomical action of the deep cervical flexor muscles, the longus capitis, and  colli. It has evolved over 15 years as both a clinical and research tool and was  devised in response to research indicating the importance of the deep cervical  flexors in support of the cervical lordosis and motion segments and clinical  observations of their impairment with neck pain. SPECIAL FEATURES: The CCFT could  be described as a test of neuromotor control. The features assessed are the  activation and isometric endurance of the deep cervical flexors as well as their  interaction with the superficial cervical flexors during the performance of five  progressive stages of increasing craniocervical flexion range of motion. It is a  low-load test performed in the supine position with the patient guided to each  stage by feedback from a pressure sensor placed behind the neck. While the test  in the clinical setting provides only an indirect measure of performance, the  construct validity of the CCFT has been verified in a laboratory setting by  direct measurement of deep and superficial flexor muscle activity. SUMMARY:  Research has established that patients with neck pain disorders, compared to  controls, have an altered neuromotor control strategy during craniocervical  flexion characterized by reduced activity in the deep cervical flexors and  increased activity in the superficial flexors usually accompanied by altered  movement strategies. Furthermore, they display reduced isometric endurance of the  deep cervical flexor muscles. The muscle impairment identified with the CCFT  appears to be generic to neck pain disorders of various etiologies. These  observations prompted the use of the craniocervical flexion action for retraining  the deep cervical flexor muscles within a motor relearning program for neck pain  patients, which has shown positive therapeutic benefits when tested in clinical  trials.},

While conventional cervical  flexion (CF) dynamometry methods have been used frequently to assess the capacity  of the cervical flexor muscles, it has been suggested that cranio-cervical  flexion (CCF) methods may provide a more specific test of DCF muscle performance.  This study compared the activation of the deep and superficial cervical flexor  muscles between tests of isometric cranio-cervical flexion (CCF) and conventional  cervical flexion (CF) dynamometry. Normalised root-mean-square values were  recorded for the deep cervical flexor (DCF), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), anterior  scalene (AS), and sternohyoid (SH) muscles during isometric CCF and CF tests at  maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), 50\% MVC, and 20\% MVC in ten healthy  volunteers. The results demonstrated significantly greater electromyography (EMG)  amplitude for the SCM (P{\textless}.001-.002) and AS (P{\textless}.001-.001) muscles in the CF test  conditions (MVC, 20\%MVC, and 50\%MVC) compared to CCF test conditions. Moreover,  the SH muscle demonstrated significantly greater EMG amplitude during CF compared  to CCF but only in the 50\% MVC and 20\% MVC conditions (P=.007 and .02  respectively). These results demonstrate that dynamometry tests of CF result in  greater activity of the superficial cervical flexor muscles compared to tests of  CCF. As a result, CCF dynamometry may provide a more specific method to assess  and retrain DCF muscle performance, compared to conventional CF in which  superficial muscle activity may mask impaired performance of the DCF muscles.},

DESIGN: Subjects lay supine and isometrically flexed their necks against a force  transducer attached to the back of a webbing and velcro helmet. Electromyograms  (EMGs) were recorded from surface electrodes on the sternocleidomastoid (SCM)  muscles. Two consecutive sessions of five contractions of varying levels of  effort from minimal through moderate and maximal effort were analyzed. SETTING:  Ambulatory referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer control subjects (n = 10, 3  men and 7 women) were recruited from hospital and university personnel. Volunteer  neck pain subjects (n = 10, 3 men and 7 women) were recruited from a physiatric  chronic pain practice and a hospital outpatient physical therapy practice.  RESULTS: In the controls, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the  first two maximum neck flexion contractions were; peak force ICC = .81; peak  force/body weight ICC = .75; average force ICC = .75; force relaxation time ICC =  .73; SCM EMG relaxation times: right ICC = .60 and left ICC = .67. Comparing  sessions 1 and 2 the intraclass correlations for SCM efficiencies were right ICC  = .58 and left ICC = .97. The peak force in controls (mean = 45.3 +/- 17.6N) was  reduced by 50\% in the neck pain subjects (mean = 22.4 +/- 13.1N) (p = .004).  Similarly, peak force/body weight in the neck pain subjects (X = 0.3 +/- 0.2N/kg)  was 46\% of control (mean = 0.7 +/- 0.2N/kg) (p = .001), and average force in the  neck pain subjects (X = 12.1 +/- 7.5N) was 43\% of controls (mean = 28.5 +/-  11.0N) (p = .001). In two neck pain subjects. SCM, EMG and force relaxation times  were abnormally long in both the affected and the unaffected SCM muscles,  exceeding the control values by greater than 3 standard deviations. The  difference between the right SCM efficiency of the control subjects (mean = 0.3  +/- 0.2N/ microV) and the affected SCM efficiency of the neck pain subjects (mean  = 0.1 +/- 0.1 N/microV) approached the p {\textless} .05 criterion for significance (p =  .055). CONCLUSION: The technique was found to be highly reliable for the  measurement of neck flexor peak force, peak force/body weight, average force, and  force relaxation time, and moderately reliable for the quantitation of SCM EMG  relaxation times and SCM efficiency. All force values were significantly lower in  the neck pain population compared with the controls. In the neck pain population,  force and SCM EMG relaxation times, as well as efficiencies, suggested  abnormalities. Neck pain subjects showed no significant differences in SCM EMG  relaxation time or SCM efficiency between affected and unaffected SCM muscles.},

RESULTS: The  average MVC was significantly lower in patients (mean ± SD, 130.0±6.0N) compared  with controls (166.9±11.7N; P{\textless}.01). Univariate regression of the average MVC with  the FABQ, NDI, or pain experienced during the MVC gave R(2) values of 13.4\%,  13.8\%, and 21.1\%, respectively. Collectively, the FABQ and pain experienced  during the MVCs resulted in an R(2) of 26.6\% and the FABQ, contraction pain, and  NDI, an R(2) of 28.2\%. CONCLUSIONS: The average maximum voluntary force produced  in neck flexion, extension, and lateral flexion is inversely and moderately  correlated with the pain experienced during maximal contraction, fear of  movement, and aspects of neck disability in patients with chronic neck pain.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study compared the neuromuscular efficiency (NME) of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and anterior scalene (AS) muscles between 20 chronic  neck pain patients and 20 asymptomatic controls. METHOD: Myoelectric signals were  recorded from the sternal head of SCM and the AS muscles as subjects performed  sub-maximal isometric cervical flexion contractions at 25 and 50\% of the maximum  voluntary contraction (MVC). The NME was calculated as the ratio between MVC and  the corresponding average rectified value of the EMG signal. Ultrasonography was  used to measure subcutaneous tissue thickness over the SCM and AS to ensure that  differences did not exist between groups. RESULTS: For both the SCM and AS  muscles, NME was shown to be significantly reduced in patients with neck pain at  25\% MVC (p{\textless}0.05). Subcutaneous tissue thickness over the SCM and AS muscles was  not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced NME in the superficial  cervical flexor muscles in patients with neck pain may be a measurable altered  muscle strategy for dysfunction in other muscles. This aberrant pattern of muscle  activation appears to be most evident under conditions of low load. NME, when  measured at 25\% MVC, may be a useful objective measure for future investigation  of muscle dysfunction in patients with neck pain.},

Thus this project was designed to investigate the association between  cervical musculoskeletal impairments and Temporomandibular Disorders. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: A sample of 154 subjects participated in this study. All subjects  underwent a series of physical tests and electromyographic assessment (i.e. head  and neck posture, maximal cervical muscle strength, cervical flexor and extensor  muscles endurance, and cervical flexor muscle performance) to determine cervical  musculoskeletal impairments. RESULTS: A strong relationship between neck  disability and jaw disability was found (r = 0.82). Craniocervical posture was  statistically different between patients with myogenous Temporomandibular  Disorders (TMD) and healthy subjects. However, the difference was too small  (3.3º) to be considered clinically relevant. Maximal cervical flexor muscle  strength was not statistically or clinically different between patients with TMD  and healthy subjects. No statistically significant differences were found in  electromyographic activity of the sternocleidomastoid or the anterior scalene  muscles in patients with TMD when compared to healthy subjects while executing  the craniocervical flexion test (P = 0.07). However, clinically important effect  sizes (0.42 - 0.82) were found. Subjects with TMD presented with reduced cervical  flexor as well as extensor muscle endurance while performing the flexor and  extensor muscle endurance tests when compared to healthy individuals.  CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with Temporomandibular Disorders presented with impairments  of the cervical flexors and extensors muscles. These results could help guide  clinicians in the assessment and prescription of more effective interventions for  individuals with Temporomandibular Disorders.},

This  study examined the relationship between myoelectric manifestations of  sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and anterior scalene (AS) muscle fatigue and duration  of neck pain in a group of patients with chronic neck pain. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Twenty chronic neck pain patients with a history of pain ranging between  1 and 25 years (mean 6.15, S.D. 5.48 years) participated in this study.  Myoelectric signals were recorded from the SCM and AS muscles from the side of  greatest pain as patients performed sustained sub-maximal isometric cervical  flexion contractions at 25\% and 50\% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC).  The initial value and slope of the mean frequency (MNF), average rectified value  (ARV) and conduction velocity (CV) of the EMG signals were calculated.  Correlation analysis was applied to determine whether a relationship existed  between the duration of neck pain and estimates of EMG variables. RESULTS AND  CONCLUSIONS: No significant correlation was found between duration of pain and  estimates of the MNF, ARV and CV for either SCM or AS contracting at 25\% and 50\%  MVC. The length of history of neck pain does not appear to correlate with the  extent of SCM and AS muscle fatigability in patients with chronic neck pain. This  finding may be due to an increase of muscle fatigability occurring within the  first few years of neck pain, which is not followed by signs of increased fatigue  after this time. This was supported by the finding of significant correlations  between duration of pain and AS fatigability on a subgroup of patients with pain  duration less than 5 years. Future studies are warranted to examine how early  signs of cervical muscle fatigability are evident after the onset of neck pain as  this will have implications for rehabilitation.},

OBJECTIVE: This study compared neck muscle activation patterns during and after a repetitive upper limb task between  patients with idiopathic neck pain, whiplash-associated disorders, and controls.  SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have identified altered motor  control of the upper trapezius during functional tasks in patients with neck  pain. Whether the cervical flexor muscles demonstrate altered motor control  during functional activities is unknown. METHODS: Electromyographic activity was  recorded from the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalenes, and upper trapezius  muscles. Root mean square electromyographic amplitude was calculated during and  on completion of a functional task. RESULTS: A general trend was evident to  suggest greatest electromyograph amplitude in the sternocleidomastoid, anterior  scalenes, and left upper trapezius muscles for the whiplash-associated disorders  group, followed by the idiopathic group, with lowest electromyographic amplitude  recorded for the control group. A reverse effect was apparent for the right upper  trapezius muscle. The level of perceived disability (Neck Disability Index score)  had a significant effect on the electromyographic amplitude recorded between neck  pain patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neck pain demonstrated greater  activation of accessory neck muscles during a repetitive upper limb task compared  to asymptomatic controls. Greater activation of the cervical muscles in patients  with neck pain may represent an altered pattern of motor control to compensate  for reduced activation of painful muscles. Greater perceived disability among  patients with neck pain accounted for the greater electromyographic amplitude of  the superficial cervical muscles during performance of the functional task.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of a craniocervical flexion exercise (CCFEx)  program to that of a conventional cervical flexion exercise (CFEx) program in  training isometric craniocervical flexor muscle performance. BACKGROUND: The  craniocervical flexor muscles are important muscles of the cervical spine, as  they have been shown to be impaired in persons with chronic neck pain. While both  CCFEx and CFEx protocols have been advocated to train craniocervical flexor  muscle performance, at present there is no consensus as to the most effective  method. METHODS AND MEASURES: Fiftyfemales with chronic mild neck pain and  disability status were randomly allocated into a 6-week program of either CCFEx  (n = 27) or CFEx (n = 23). Isometric dynamometry measurements of craniocervical  flexor muscle performance (maximal voluntary contraction, endurance at 50\%'of  maximal voluntary contraction) were recorded before and following the exercise  program. Changes in craniocervical flexor muscle performance  (pretraining-posttraining) within and between exercise groups were analyzed with  analysis of variance models. RESULTS: Both exercise interventions significantly  improved isometric craniocervical flexor muscle performance (P{\textless}.02). No  significant differences in improvement of muscle performance were observed  between the2 exercise interventions. CONCLUSION: It appearsthat isometric  craniocervical flexor muscle performance can be Strained with either a CCFEx  protocol or a conventional CFEx protocol in patients with mild neck pain and  disability.},

METHODS:  Seventy women with migraine between 18 and 55 years of age diagnosed according to  International Headache Society criteria were assessed. Participants provided  clinical information regarding neck pain and headache. The Neck Disability Index  was used to assess neck-related disability, and neck muscle strength was assessed  via maximum voluntary contraction during flexion, extension, and lateral flexion  with a handheld dynamometer. The correlation was verified with Spearman's  correlation coefficient (ρ). Multiple linear regression was performed to verify  whether the clinical variables could predict the strength of neck muscles. All  calculations were performed adopting a level of significance of 0.05. RESULTS:  Neck extensor strength was negatively correlated with all clinical variables  (ρ(range) = -.24 to -.32, p {\textless} .05); lateral flexor strength was negatively  correlated with headache frequency, neck pain intensity, and neck-related  disability (ρ(range) = -.27 to -.39, p {\textless} .05); and flexor strength also  correlated negatively with neck pain intensity and related disability (ρ(r) =  -.26 to -.29, p {\textless} .05).

CONCLUSIONS: For the women with migraine in this study, correlations of headache  and neck pain with neck muscle strength features were weakly to moderately  negative.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The craniocervical flexion test assesses the deep cervical flexor muscles (longus capitis, longus colli). Ideally, electromyography (EMG) studies  measure activity in both deep and superficial (sternocleidomastoid, anterior  scalene) flexors during the test, but most studies confine recordings to  superficial muscle activity as the technique to record the deep muscles is  invasive. Higher activity of the superficial flexors has been interpreted as an  indicator of reduced deep flexor activity in people with neck pain but how close  the inverse relationship is during this test is unknown. METHODS: EMG was  recorded from the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene and deep cervical flexor  muscles to quantify their relationship during the craniocervical flexion test,  from 32 women (age: 38.0 ± 11.6 yrs) with a history of chronic non-specific neck  pain. The range of craniocervical flexion at each of the five test stages was  also measured. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation was identified  (r = -0.45; P {\textless} 0.01) between the average normalized EMG amplitude of the deep  cervical flexors and sternocleidomastoid across all stages of the craniocervical  flexion test. There was a moderate although weaker and non-significant negative  correlation between deep cervical flexors and anterior scalene activity  (r = -0.34; P = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS: The results affirm the interpretation that  higher levels of activity of the superficial flexor muscles are an indicator of  reduced deep cervical flexor activity in the craniocervical flexion test. Further  studies of neuromuscular and movement strategies used by people with neck pain to  compensate for poorer activation of the deep cervical flexors will inform best  clinical assessment.},

OBJECTIVE: The present study compared activity of deep and superficial cervical flexor muscles and craniocervical  flexion range of motion during a test of craniocervical flexion between 10  patients with chronic neck pain and 10 controls. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:  Individuals with chronic neck pain exhibit reduced performance on a test of  craniocervical flexion, and training of this maneuver is effective in management  of neck complaints. Although this test is hypothesized to reflect dysfunction of  the deep cervical flexor muscles, this has not been tested. METHODS: Deep  cervical flexor electromyographic activity was recorded with custom electrodes  inserted via the nose and fixed by suction to the posterior mucosa of the  oropharynx. Surface electrodes were placed over the superficial neck muscles  (sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene). Root mean square electromyographic  amplitude and craniocervical flexion range of motion was measured during five  incremental levels of craniocervical flexion in supine. RESULTS: There was a  strong linear relation between the electromyographic amplitude of the deep  cervical flexor muscles and the incremental stages of the craniocervical flexion  test for control and individuals with neck pain (P = 0.002). However, the  amplitude of deep cervical flexor electromyographic activity was less for the  group with neck pain than controls, and this difference was significant for the  higher increments of the task (P {\textless} 0.05). Although not significant, there was a  strong trend for greater sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene  electromyographic activity for the group with neck pain. CONCLUSIONS: These data  confirm that reduced performance of the craniocervical flexion test is associated  with dysfunction of the deep cervical flexor muscles and support the validity of  this test for patients with neck pain.},

	abstract = {Increasingly complex models of the neck neuromusculature need detailed muscle and kinematic data for proper validation. The goal of this study was to measure the  electromyographic activity of superficial and deep neck muscles during tasks  involving isometric, voluntary, and reflexively evoked contractions of the neck  muscles. Three male subjects (28-41 years) had electromyographic (EMG) fine wires  inserted into the left sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, splenius  capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and multifidus muscles.  Surface electrodes were placed over the left sternohyoid muscle. Subjects then  performed: (i) maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) in the eight directions (45  deg intervals) from the neutral posture; (ii) 50 N isometric contractions with a  slow sweep of the force direction through 720 deg; (iii) voluntary oscillatory  head movements in flexion and extension; and (iv) initially relaxed reflex muscle  activations to a forward acceleration while seated on a sled. Isometric  contractions were performed against an overhead load cell and movement dynamics  were measured using six-axis accelerometry on the head and torso. In all three  subjects, the two anterior neck muscles had similar preferred activation  directions and acted synergistically in both dynamic tasks. With the exception of  splenius capitis, the posterior and posterolateral neck muscles also showed  consistent activation directions and acted synergistically during the voluntary  motions, but not during the sled perturbations. These findings suggest that the  common numerical-modeling assumption that all anterior muscles act  synergistically as flexors is reasonable, but that the related assumption that  all posterior muscles act synergistically as extensors is not. Despite the small  number of subjects, the data presented here can be used to inform and validate a  neck model at three levels of increasing neuromuscular-kinematic complexity:  muscles generating forces with no movement, muscles generating forces and causing  movement, and muscles generating forces in response to induced movement. These  increasingly complex data sets will allow researchers to incrementally tune their  neck models' muscle geometry, physiology, and feedforward/feedback  neuromechanics.},

	abstract = {Despite the evidence of greater fatigability of the cervical flexor muscles in neck pain patients, the effect of unilaterality of neck pain on muscle fatigue  has not been investigated. This study compared myoelectric manifestations of  sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and anterior scalene (AS) muscle fatigue between the  painful and non-painful sides in patients with chronic unilateral neck pain.  Myoelectric signals were recorded from the sternal head of SCM and the AS muscles  bilaterally during sub-maximal isometric cervical flexion contractions at 25\% and  50\% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The time course of the mean power  frequency, average rectified value and conduction velocity of the  electromyographic signals were calculated to quantify myoelectric manifestations  of muscle fatigue. Results revealed greater estimates of the initial value and  slope of the mean frequency for both the SCM and AS muscles on the side of the  patient's neck pain at 25\% and 50\% of MVC. These results indicate greater  myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue of the superficial cervical flexor  muscles ipsilateral to the side of pain. This suggests a specificity of the  effect of pain on muscle function and hence the need for specificity of  therapeutic exercise in the management of neck pain patients.},

The aim of this study was  to compare neck muscle endurance and fatigue characteristics during sub-maximal  isometric endurance tests in patients with postural neck pain, with asymptomatic  subjects. Thirteen female patients with postural neck pain and 12 asymptomatic  female control subjects completed timed sub-maximal muscle endurance tests for  the neck flexor and extensor muscles. Muscle fatigue, defined as the  time-dependent decrease in median frequency electromyography (EMG), was examined  using surface EMG analysis during the tests. The median extensor test holding  time was lower but not significantly different in the neck pain group (165 s)  that the control group (228 s) (p = 0.17). There was no difference between groups  in the flexor test holding time (neck pain = 36 s, controls = 38 s) (p = 0.96).  The neck pain group was characterised by greater variability in neck flexor (p =  0.03) and extensor (p = 0.006) muscle endurance. For both tests, the rate of  decrease in median frequency EMG was highly variable within and between groups  with no significant difference between groups for the flexor or extensor test (p  = 0.05-0.82). Patients with postural neck pain did not have significant  impairment of neck muscle endurance or accelerated fatigue compared to control  subjects. However, the greater variability in these indices of muscle function  may reflect patient-specific changes in muscle function associated with neck pain  disorder.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to compare the co-activation of cervical agonist and antagonist muscles between people with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) and  healthy controls during brief isometric cervical flexion and extension  contractions. Nine women with CTTH and 10 matched controls participated. Surface  electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from the sternocleidomastoid and  splenius capitis muscles bilaterally during cervical flexion and extension  contractions of linearly increasing force from 0\% to 60\% of the maximum voluntary  contraction (MVC) in 3 s. Sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis EMG average  rectified values (ARV) were estimated at 10\% MVC force increments. During  cervical extension contraction, sternocleidomastoid (i.e. antagonist muscle) ARV  was greater for patients than for controls in the force range 20-60\% MVC (P =  0.029). During cervical flexion, the left splenius capitis (i.e. antagonist  muscle) ARV was greater for CTTH patients regardless of the force level (P =  0.02). Maximum cervical flexion and extension force was lower for the CTTH  patients compared with controls (P = 0.001). In conclusion, women with CTTH  demonstrated greater co-activation of antagonist musculature during cervical  extension and flexion contractions compared with healthy women. Increased  co-activation of antagonist musculature may reflect reorganization of the motor  control strategy in CTTH patients, potentially leading to muscle overload and  increased nociception.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There is relatively little known concerning the spectral profile of the cervical muscles, despite the fact that neck injury and pain are  quite prevalent. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to calculate and study  the power spectral characteristics of the sternocleidomastoids, splenii capitis  and upper trapezii in anterolateral flexion and posterolateral extension in a  ramp contraction. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: In a laboratory setting experiments were  conducted to record surface electromyographic (EMG) data from six cervical  muscles and power spectral variables obtained. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty normal and  healthy young adults (21 men, 19 women). OUTCOME MEASURES: Power spectral of EMG  signals. METHODS: EMG data for the left and right isometric anterolateral flexion  and posterolateral extension were acquired from the sternocleidomastoids, splenii  capitis and upper trapezius bilaterally. The subjects were seated in an upright  posture and exerted left and right anterolateral flexor and posterolateral  extensor efforts from rest to their maximal voluntary contraction in a gradual  linear ramp fashion using visual feedback as a guide. The force exerted and the  surface EMG data were sampled at 1 kHz at every 10th percentile grade of  contraction and the EMG data were subjected to the Fast-Fourier transform  analysis. The median frequency (MF), mean power frequency (MPF), peak power and  total power of all six cervical muscles were analyzed. RESULTS: In the  anterolateral flexion the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis  had a wider band of frequency, which further widened with increasing grade of  contraction. The trapezius did not engage in the same manner or to the same  magnitude. The MF of the sternocleidomastoid in the anterolateral flexion in both  genders progressively increased, the splenius capitis remained relatively  unchanged, and the upper trapezius declined with the increasing grades of  contraction. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference between the genders  in spectral profile. There is a bilateral symmetry in spectral profile with  reference to activity; however, they are significantly different in different  activities for the same muscles. With increasing magnitude of contraction power,  spectral density distribution increases and the median frequency decreases. These  results can serve as a useful reference for painful necks. Restoration of power  spectral characteristics may indicate normalcy, which cannot be gleaned by other  EMG or force variables.},

Strength and endurance time  (time to task failure in seconds) at 50\% maximal voluntary contraction were  recorded in 4 directions (craniocervical flexion/extension and cervicothoracic  flexion/extension) and 6 strength and endurance ratios were calculated.  Participants in both groups were matched for body mass index. The idiopathic neck  pain group demonstrated significantly less strength for the cervicothoracic  flexors and extensors (1.58-4.7 N·m [12.4\%-17.9\%] less, P {\textless} .04) and  significantly less endurance time for the cervicothoracic and craniocervical  flexors (10.77-10.9 s [23.3\%-27.5\%] less, P {\textless} .03). The cervicothoracic extension  to craniocervical flexion strength ratio was also lower in the idiopathic neck  pain group (P = .01); however, no other strength or endurance ratio was  significantly different between groups. This exploratory study suggests assessing  specific performance parameters accounting for regional muscular differences in  the upper and lower neck is potentially informative to understanding impairments  in neck pain conditions, particularly as impairments may not be uniform across  muscle groups.},
